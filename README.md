# Bookmark Manager Challenge

This is my solution to the Bookmark Challenge at Makers Academy during my 4th week.
The project is based on building a bookmark manager.  A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of URLs. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

### User Stories:

```
As a User 
So that I can quickly access my saved links 
I want to see a list of my bookmarks

As a User 
So that I can bookmark a page 
I want to to be able to add a link to my list of bookmarks

As a User 
So that I can organize my bookmarks 
I want to be able to add a tag to my bookmarks

As a User 
So that I can easily access a type of bookmark/link 
I want to be able to filter my tags
```
